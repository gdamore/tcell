## Tcell views

This package provides some enhanced functionality on top of base _Tcell_.
In particular, support for logical views, and a few different kinds of
widgets like title bars, and scrollable areas, are provided.

These make up a higher level interface than tcell itself.

This is mostly intended to demonstrate some possibilities for how to use
_Tcell_, and is not a complete widget library. It may be sufficient for
simpler applications, and could serve as an example or base from which to
build a richer widget library.

If you're looking for a complete, ready-to-use, widget framework, we recommend
checking out the [UI Frameworks](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/wiki/Gallery#ui-frameworks)
in the Gallery.
