// EventKey represents a key press.  Usually this is a key press followed
// by a key release, but since terminal programs don't have a way to report
// key release events, we usually get just one event.  If a key is held down
// then the terminal may synthesize repeated key presses at some predefined
// rate.  We have no control over that, nor visibility into it.
//
// In some cases, we can have a modifier key, such as ModAlt, that can be
// generated with a key press.  (This usually is represented by having the
// high bit set, or in some cases, by sending an ESC prior to the rune.)
//
// If the value of Key() is KeyRune, then the actual key value will be
// available with the Rune() method.  This will be the case for most keys.
// In most situations, the modifiers will not be set.  For example, if the
// rune is 'A', this will be reported without the ModShift bit set, since
// really can't tell if the Shift key was pressed (it might have been CAPSLOCK,
// or a terminal that only can send capitals, or keyboard with separate
// capital letters from lower case letters).
//
// Generally, terminal applications have far less visibility into keyboard
// activity than graphical applications.  Hence, they should avoid depending
// overly much on availability of such details.
