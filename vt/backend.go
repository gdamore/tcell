// Backend describes the backend of a terminal.
// This can be used to create a real emulator, while allowing the processor
// front end to handle the common details of parsing escape sequences, the state
// machine, and so forth. Backends support a limited set of common functionality,
// including a cursor. They only need to support writing at the cursor.

	// SetPrivateMode sets a private mode to the given status.
	// If either value is invalid, this should simply ignore the operation.

	// The X and Y are counts, so the bottom right cell should be at coordinate (X-1, Y-1).

	// Colors returns the number of colors this terminal can support.  For direct color,
	// return 1<<24. The XTerm palette is assumed. Monochrome terminals should return 0.

	// Put content at the given location. The string in the cell might be a grapheme cluster, and the width can be

	// double buffering.)

	// the cursor shape, it should implement at least hidden, steady, and blinking (typically as a block).
